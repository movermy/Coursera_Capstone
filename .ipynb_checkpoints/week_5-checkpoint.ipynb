    "So many people move to an area unfamiliar to them for a job. These moves often occur in a tight time-frame due to schedule pressures with career start dates.

What if there was there was tool that related neighborhoods in a new city to those a person was already familiar with?\n",

    "This report stands as a successful demonstration of a move recommendation tool. \n",
    "\n",
    "The example contained here delivers dynamically navigable maps of the \"from\" locations (Toronto and Manhattan) as well as the \"to\" locations (Queens and Staten Island) which included clustered regions. Using these maps, with their individually clustered neighborhoods, each location can be manually audited for trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, two final maps are provided which show the clustered model of all neighborhoods. Using these maps, The majority of \"from\" locations can be mapped to similar location in Queens and Staten Island. This mapping is summarized in the move recommendation table above, where specific move recommendations are contained.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the methods used in this report can be broadly applied to arbitrary \"to\" and \"from\" locations. Because the methods used here are automated, the goal of creating a scalable recommendation model is satisfied.\n"
